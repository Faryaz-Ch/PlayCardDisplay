C# program that asks from the user for the letter of a play card. The user input must be either J, Q, K, or A. Perform user input validation. 
If user input is not one of the four specified letters, your program must prompt for re-entry until a valid input is received. 
Once a valid letter is received, a selection statement should be used to display corresponding messages as follow
J = Jack or Q = Queen or K = King or A = Ace
